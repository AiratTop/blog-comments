# blog-comments

Repository for storing comments and discussions linked to [blog.airat.top](https://blog.airat.top).

This repo is used by the [giscus](https://giscus.app) widget. Every article on the blog opens a dedicated discussion here, so readers can comment and react using their GitHub accounts.

## How it works

1. giscus connects to this repository via GitHub Discussions.
2. When a visitor posts a comment, giscus creates or updates the corresponding discussion topic.
3. Replies, reactions, and moderation can be managed directly in the Discussions tab.

_No code lives hereâ€”only the discussions that power the blog comments._
